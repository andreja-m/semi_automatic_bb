## semi automatic bug bounty automation framework

this is my project for automated bug bounty scanning of multiple projects (aka bounty programs i'm participating in) with multiple security tools like:
- sqlmap
- owasp zap
- rustscan
- gobuster
and probably will add some more while working on a project.
